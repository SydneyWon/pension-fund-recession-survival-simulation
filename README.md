# Pension Fund Recession Survival Simulation
This project simulates the survival of a typical pension fund over a 10-year period using Monte Carlo methods.


## Project Highlights

- Simulated 10-year portfolio performance using expected return and volatility inputs
- Modeled both a "normal" market scenario and a "recession" scenario based on OECD and institutional estimates
- Quantified underfunding risk using a defined solvency threshold (â‚¬800 million)
- Emphasized the need for stress testing in pension fund management and long-term planning


## Key Learnings

- Under normal assumptions, the fund survives in most cases  
- Under a recession scenario, the risk of underfunding rises dramatically  
- This analysis demonstrates how return assumptions and volatility drastically affect long-term financial health  
- Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful tool for assessing uncertainty in financial modeling


## Tech Stack

- Python, pandas, NumPy
- Monte Carlo Simulation  
- Matplotlib for visualization
